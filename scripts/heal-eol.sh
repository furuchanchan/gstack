# heal-eol.sh — rewrite LF-pinned bash scripts that an older CRLF checkout left CRLF.
#
# Why: .gitattributes pins every bash script (and the hook shims) to LF, and the
# hook parse gate in ./setup refuses a CRLF bash file, because bash keeps the \r
# on every line at run time. An install checked out on Windows with
# core.autocrlf=true BEFORE those rules existed still holds CRLF working copies,
# and `git pull` never rewrites a file whose blob did not change. Without this,
# such an install would be refused by its own next ./setup after upgrading.
#
# What it touches, and only that: a tracked file whose index copy is LF, whose
# attribute says eol=lf, whose working copy is CRLF, whose first line is a
# bash/sh shebang (the files the gate would refuse — a handful, not the tree),
# that is not flagged assume-unchanged or skip-worktree (`git diff` cannot see
# edits behind either flag), and that carries no content change
# (`git diff --quiet`, which compares after normalisation).
#
# How: the bytes a fresh checkout would write come from
# `git cat-file --filters`, go to a temp file beside the original (carrying its
# mode), and replace it with one `mv`. Nothing is deleted first, no
# checkout runs, no hook fires, and a failure leaves the original exactly as it
# was and says so. Best effort: no git, not a work tree, or nothing to heal is
# a silent exit 0; the hook parse gate still judges the tree afterwards.
# Usage: heal-eol.sh <repo-root>
#
# POSIXLY_CORRECT or POSIX_PEDANTIC, or `posix` in an exported SHELLOPTS,
# starts bash in POSIX mode, where bash 3.2 rejects the process substitution
# that feeds the loop below: the heal died on a syntax error, setup carried
# on, and the gate then refused the CRLF copy this script exists to rewrite.
# Turning the mode off covers all three for this script's own parse; unlike
# the gate, it parses no other file.
